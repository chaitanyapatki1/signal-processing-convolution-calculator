## üìã How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions
- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues or improve existing functionality
- **Feature additions**: Add new signal processing capabilities
- **Documentation**: Improve README, comments, or add tutorials
- **UI/UX improvements**: Enhance the user interface and experience
- **Performance optimizations**: Improve application speed and efficiency
- **Testing**: Add or improve test coverage

### Before You Start
1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/signal-processing-convolution-calculator/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal
3. Make sure your development environment is properly set up

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing and avoid `any` types
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex algorithms and signal processing logic
- **Formatting**: The project uses ESLint for consistent code formatting

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Good component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  // Define clear prop types
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    // JSX with proper Tailwind classes
  );
};

export default Component;
```

### Signal Processing Guidelines
- Implement algorithms clearly with step-by-step comments
- Maintain mathematical accuracy in convolution calculations
- Provide educational value through clear trace outputs
- Test with various signal inputs and edge cases

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow the existing dark theme with blue accents
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Add smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Use Lucide React icons consistently

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test all signal input methods (manual entry, presets)
- Verify convolution calculations with known results
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes
- Test all navigation flows and error states

### Test Cases to Consider
- Empty signals
- Single-element signals
- Large signals (performance testing)
- Negative values
- Zero values
- Edge cases in search functionality
